        <p>I was born in New York but spent most of my life in Seattle. I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood, where life was pretty normal—weekend baseball games, school projects, and late-night video games with friends.</p>
        <p>I went to a public high school where I first got interested in computers. At first, I was just another kid playing around with software, trying to customize my desktop and figuring out how things worked. But one day, I stumbled upon a book about programming in the school library, and that changed everything. I started coding simple programs, building small websites, and messing around with basic security concepts just out of curiosity.</p>
        <p>After high school, I decided to study Computer Science. During college, I got my first internship in IT support, which later turned into a junior security role. That was when I realized how much I enjoyed cybersecurity—analyzing systems, understanding vulnerabilities, and finding ways to make things more secure. Over time, I transitioned into a full-time career in security and programming, working with different companies to protect their networks and data.</p>
        <p>Now, I run my own blog where I share insights about antivirus software, VPNs, and other security tools. I believe that good cybersecurity knowledge should be accessible to everyone, whether you're a tech expert or just someone who wants to stay safe online.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking around the Pacific Northwest, exploring new tech trends, and sometimes just relaxing with a good book or a classic video game.</p>
